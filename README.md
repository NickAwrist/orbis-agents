# Orbis Agents

A local-first agent runtime with a run UI, powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/).

Build custom agents directly from the UI. Each agent can have its own system prompt and a configurable set of tools, letting you tailor behavior to specific tasks without touching code.

Custom skills live under **Customization > Skills**. A skill follows the
`SKILL.md` shape: a lowercase hyphenated name, a description that tells agents
when to use it, and Markdown instructions. Agents receive only the skill
metadata until they load a matching skill. Type `$skill-name` in a message to
invoke one directly.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally

## Setup

```bash
bun install
```

## Development

Runs the backend server and UI together.

```bash
bun run dev
```

Individual processes:

```bash
bun run dev:server
bun run dev:ui
```

Create your own local settings file, then edit it before starting the app:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Bun and Vite load `.env` automatically. Restart the dev processes after changing it.
The file is ignored by Git. For example:

```bash
AGENTS_BACKEND_PORT=3000
AGENTS_BACKEND_HOST=127.0.0.1
AGENTS_FRONTEND_PORT=5174
AGENTS_OLLAMA_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:11434
AGENTS_COMFYUI_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8188
AGENTS_SEARXNG_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

If these are omitted, the app keeps its existing defaults. Endpoint values saved in the Settings UI take precedence over `.env` endpoint values.

In development, the backend API and Vite UI are separate processes:

- `AGENTS_BACKEND_PORT` controls the API server. Default: `3000`.
- `AGENTS_FRONTEND_PORT` controls the Vite dev server. Default: `5174`.

## Worktree development

From a new worktree, run:

```bash
bun run init:worktree
# Edit .env, including unused AGENTS_BACKEND_PORT and AGENTS_FRONTEND_PORT values.
bun run dev
```

The initializer copies your primary checkout's `.env`, or `.env.example` if no
local file exists. It sets `AGENTS_DB_PATH` and `ORBIS_DATA_ROOT` to the worktree's
own `data/` directory and links the primary checkout's `node_modules` when available.
Existing `.env` files and dependencies are preserved. Run `bun install` if the
primary checkout has no dependencies installed.

New worktrees copy the primary checkout's SQLite database and retained workspaces.
The database snapshot includes committed WAL data. Existing destination data is
preserved, and rerunning setup with an existing `.env` does not copy data again.
Temporary workspaces and trash are not copied. Saved endpoint settings still take
precedence over `.env`; clear them in Settings to use your environment values.
Service endpoints, API keys, and
`AGENTS_HOST_DIRECTORY` are copied unchanged. Open `/` on your configured Vite
port to use the full app with these settings.

You can also run `bun run init:worktree /path/to/worktree` from the primary checkout.
T3 Code can invoke the same command on worktree creation using its
`T3CODE_PROJECT_ROOT` and `T3CODE_WORKTREE_PATH` variables. Running it in the primary
checkout creates `.env` from the example if needed.

The `/dev/...` routes are isolated UI examples for automated browser checks.
Unit tests continue to use an in-memory database and mocked services.

## Docker

Run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The production Docker container is different from development: it serves the
built UI and API from the same backend process, so there is only one app port.
The Dockerfile installs Bubblewrap, which the shell tools require. Compose allows
its nested namespaces and procfs mount by disabling Docker's seccomp, AppArmor,
and system-path restrictions for this service. This reduces the container's outer
isolation; Bubblewrap still restricts each shell command to its workspace and
isolates its network. No privileged mode or extra host capabilities are granted.
When the backend runs as root, local-directory shell commands use the directory
owner's UID and GID through `setpriv`, supplied by `util-linux`. This permits
access through private home directories and creates files owned by that user.
Rebuild and recreate existing containers after updating these files with
`deployctl restart <deployment> --build` for deployctl-managed installations.
On Linux, Docker Compose runs it with host networking so host-local services
like Ollama and ComfyUI are reachable at `127.0.0.1` and `localhost`.
`AGENTS_BACKEND_PORT` is the web UI/API port used by the production container.

With defaults, the UI is available at `http://localhost:3000`. For example,
this serves the UI on `http://localhost:5174`:

```bash
AGENTS_BACKEND_PORT=5174
docker compose up
```

App data is persisted in the `agents-data` Docker volume.

Compose also mounts your host home directory read/write at its original absolute
path. The directory picker starts there, and `~` expands to that folder. Selecting
a local workspace lets the chat edit files in that host folder.

To use a different folder, set an existing absolute path in `.env`:

```bash
AGENTS_HOST_DIRECTORY=/home/your-user/projects
```

Set this explicitly when deploying through a service account or `sudo`, whose
`HOME` may differ from yours. Recreate the container after changing the mount:

```bash
docker compose up -d --force-recreate
```

Paths outside that mount still refer to the container filesystem. To access
another host location, add a bind mount with the same source and target path.
The mount does not change per-chat containment: tools still use the selected
workspace as `/workspace`.

When Ollama or ComfyUI are running on the same Linux host, these local endpoint
values work because the container shares the host network namespace:

```bash
AGENTS_OLLAMA_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:11434
AGENTS_COMFYUI_HOST=http://127.0.0.1:8188
```

If you run this Compose file on Docker Desktop for macOS or Windows, host
networking has different behavior. In that case, use the local Bun dev commands
or switch the Compose file back to port publishing plus
`host.docker.internal`.

## Workspaces

Shell commands and file tools use `/workspace` for both private and selected
local workspaces. File tools also accept relative paths within that directory.
The UI shows the selected host directory for local workspaces.

Workspace file operations require Linux with procfs. Reads, writes, directory
listing, and scans open path components without following symlinks. Deletes use
an open parent directory and unlink the final entry without following it. Ignore
rules are read only from within the workspace through the same protected access.

Temporary workspaces expire after 24 hours. The server checks for expired leases
and abandoned directories every minute, deferring deletion during active turns.
Leaving a temporary chat requests deletion immediately. Selected local directories
are never removed by temporary workspace cleanup.

The sandbox integration tests report skips when Bubblewrap is unavailable. Run
`bun test --preload ./tests/setup.ts tests/sandbox` on a Linux host with working
Bubblewrap namespaces to verify workspace writes and network isolation.

### Bubblewrap on Ubuntu 24.04

If shell tools report `loopback: Failed RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted`,
check `journalctl -k` for AppArmor denials involving `bwrap` and the
`unprivileged_userns` profile. Ubuntu can block the capabilities Bubblewrap
needs to create its sandbox, including its isolated loopback interface.

For `/usr/bin/bwrap`, install the included application-specific profile:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 config/apparmor/orbis-bwrap /etc/apparmor.d/orbis-bwrap
sudo apparmor_parser -r /etc/apparmor.d/orbis-bwrap
```

This follows [Ubuntu's application-specific user namespace guidance](https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-23-10-restricted-unprivileged-user-namespaces).
The profile permits Bubblewrap to create user namespaces. The runner continues
using its filesystem restrictions and isolated network namespace.

Restart the backend after loading the profile because it caches the sandbox
capability check. Then run the sandbox tests above; workspace writes and network
isolation tests should run rather than skip.

## Message UI demo and browser checks

Run `bun run dev:ui` and open `/dev/messages` on the Vite server. The demo uses
real message components with in-memory examples for single-line, multiline, and
scrolling code. Hold a user message for its actions; tap the dots beside an assistant reply.
Copy, edit, retry confirmation, and trace viewing work without a
backend or model. Reload to reset the examples. The route and fixtures are
excluded from production builds.

To check the layout on a headless server:

```bash
bunx playwright install chromium --no-shell
bun run test:browser
```

The browser checks start a temporary Vite server on port 5199, exercise mobile
and desktop interactions, and save conversation and popover screenshots in
`.cache/browser-results/`. No display server is needed. Files use `.pw.ts` so
Bun's unit-test discovery does not run the Playwright suite.
